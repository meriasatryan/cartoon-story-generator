In the second scene, the flamingo begins a gentle walk along the water's edge, the fish still in its beak. The wind begins to blow softly, causing the water to ripple and the reeds in the landscape to sway gently. The camera follows the flamingo's movement with a slow zoom, focusing on the graceful rhythm of its steps.
