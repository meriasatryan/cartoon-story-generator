In the final scene, the flamingo takes flight, the fish dropping from its beak and splashing back into the water. As the flamingo ascends, the clouds in the sky start to move, adding dynamism to the tranquil landscape. The camera tilts slightly, following the flamingo's ascent, before pulling back to show the flamingo soaring into the soft, natural light.
