In the opening scene, we see the flamingo, its head submerged in the water. The light is soft and the water landscape is peaceful. As the scene progresses, the flamingo slowly lifts its head out of the water, revealing a small fish in its beak. In the background, the sunlight shifts subtly, casting longer shadows and giving the scene a slightly more orange hue. The camera pans slowly to the left, allowing the viewers to take in the broader landscape surrounding the flamingo.
